# raft

This is an implementation of the [Raft distributed consensus protocol][paper].
It's heavily influenced by [benbjohnson's implementation][goraft].
It focuses on providing a clean and usable API, and well-structured internals.

## Usage

A node in a Raft network is represented by a [Server][server] structure. In a
typical application, nodes will create a Server, and expose it to other nodes
using a [Peer][peer] interface.

[server]: http://godoc.org/github.com/peterbourgon/raft#Server
[peer]: http://godoc.org/github.com/peterbourgon/raft#Peer

Servers are only useful when they can communicate with other servers. This
library includes a [HTTP Transport][httpt] (ingress) and [HTTP Peer][httpp]
(egress) which combine to allow communication via REST-ish endpoints. For now,
it's the simplest way to embed a Raft server in your application. See [this
complete example][example-http].

[httpt]: http://godoc.org/github.com/peterbourgon/raft#HTTPTransport
[httpp]: http://godoc.org/github.com/peterbourgon/raft#NewHTTPPeer
[example-http]: http://godoc.org/github.com/peterbourgon/raft#_example_NewServer--HTTP

Several other transports are coming; see TODO, below.


## Adding and removing nodes

The Raft protocol has no affordance for node discovery or "join/leave"
semantics. Rather, the protocol assumes an ideal network configuration that's
known _a priori_ to nodes in the network, and describes a mechanism (called
joint-consensus) to safely replicate that configuration.

My implementation of joint-consensus abides those fundamental assumptions. Nodes
may be added or removed dynamically by requesting a **SetConfiguration** that
describes a complete network topology.


## TODO

* ~~Leader election~~ _done_
* ~~Log replication~~ _done_
* ~~Basic unit tests~~ _done_
* ~~HTTP transport~~ _done_
* [net/rpc][netrpc] transport
* Other transports?
* ~~Configuration changes (joint-consensus mode)~~ _done_
* Log compaction **in progress**
* Robust demo application â˜œ **in progress**
* Complex unit tests (one per scenario described in the paper)
